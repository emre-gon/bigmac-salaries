## Known Issues <a name = "issues"></a>

I was using oecd average tax wedge[ðŸ”—](https://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/taxing-wages-brochure.pdf) to calculate net wage from gross national minimum wage, (for countries except Turkey). This was causing purchasing power of minimum wage to look worse than it is.

Instead I started to use lowest marginal individual income tax rates in this link [ðŸ”—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_rates).

If there is a better source feel free to contribute.
